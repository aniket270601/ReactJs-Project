1. Grant devops user Permission to Restart Nginx
Modify the systemd service permissions so that devops can restart Nginx without sudo.

Step 1: Create a Systemd Override for Nginx
Run the following command:

sudo systemctl edit nginx
This will open an editor. Add the following content:


[Service]
ExecStartPost=/bin/chown devops:devops /run/nginx.pid
Save and exit.

Step 2: Reload Systemd to Apply Changes

sudo systemctl daemon-reexec


2. Verify that devops user has permissions to /var/www/html
